		You can end the mission at any point, once all players are back at the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrStart"">start</marker>. You can then use the support interface to end the mission.<br /><br />Once an area has been cleared of mortar positions and most of the enemy killed, your task will be updated along with the sectors on your map (changing to green if cleared).

		 A final assault is being carried out on <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAirbase"">Rasman Airbase</marker>. Takistani forces are now pushed back into a defensive position. Unfortunately the assault from the north western sectors has come to a halt as allied forces are being pinned down by enemy mortar fire, making it hard for any ground troops to gain a foothold in the area and advance further.
		<br />
		<br />
		 The Takistani Army have placed mortar positions within the town of <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAO"">Rasman</marker> and due to high civilian presence, airstrikes are not possible. Command did not want to assault the airbase from the town to avoid civilian casulaties, but they are now left with no other choice. These mortar positions must be taken out in order to allow ground troops to move in and secure the airbase.		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Intel</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 Several mortar positions are located throughout <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAO"">Rasman Valley</marker>. Use explosive charges to destroy them. Intel indicates much of the Takistani army have retreated and consolidated their forces within <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAirbase"">Rasman Airbase</marker>, so expect heavy infantry resistance.<br /><br /> The Takistani militia are also in force within the AO. Be careful not to mistake them for civilians.<br /><br /> We have managed to sneak you in just <marker name=""TOUR_mkrStart"">south of the area</marker>, using three stolen Takistani Army trucks. Make sure you stay within the valley. In high open ground you will be spotted, and make easy prey for their mortars.

		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Support</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 Fire support is available for this mission by the M119 artillery units (Stampede), but limited to smoke artillery only. Soldiers with a PRC-148 radio can access this through the support interface.<br /><br /> Extra ammo and medical equipment has been supplied within the trucks incase you need to rearm and resupply. Explosive charges are also within the trucks inventory for use against the mortar positions.
